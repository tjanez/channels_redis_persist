A (hopefully) short-lived fork of Django Channels' `channels_redis`_ package
that adds support for persistent connections to Redis.

We plan on working with upstream to merge these changes back into
`channels_redis`_. If you want to follow the progress, see:

- `upstream issue report on reconnecting every time`_
- `upstream pull request adding persistence to connections`_

**Note:** Since this is meant to be a short-lived fork of channels_redis
package, we didn't rename the Python package (i.e. it is still called
``channels_redis``).

For all other information, refer to to the `channels_redis`_ package's README.

.. _upstream pull request adding persistence to connections:

Note to developers
------------------

We plan on following `channels_redis`_'s releases and augmenting them with the
``.rev<n>`` post release suffix.
For example, channels_redis_persist versions ``2.2.1.rev1``, ``2.2.1.rev2``,
... will correspond to channels_redis version ``2.2.1`` with patches adding
persistent connections support applied on top.

**Note:** The commits on the ``master`` branch will not be *stable*, i.e. they
will be continuously rebased on top of channels_redis's ``master`` branch.
